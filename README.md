# Smashing Stations
In the future, this thing will have real styles and be written in a way that
actually makes it maintainable. But for now, since it isn't really being
actively worked on, enjoy the dirty hacked-together version.

## Running the App
Download Node 5.10.x or newer: https://nodejs.org

Grab bower: `npm install -g bower`.

Install packages: `npm install` then `bower install`.

Start the app: `npm start`.

## Deployment
Simply download the PCF command line tool from https://console.run.pivotal.io and run `cf push`.

## Tests
Shamefully, not yet tested. This will change with the first real commit.
